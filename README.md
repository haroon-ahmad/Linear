Linear regression with one variable
In this part of this exercise, I will implement linear regression with one variable to predict proﬁts for a bakery franchise. 
 I have data for proﬁts and populations from the cities. I would like to use this data to help me select which city to expand to next.

The ﬁle ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The ﬁrst column is the population of a city and the second column is the proﬁt of an outlet in that city. A negative value for proﬁt indicates a loss.

First i will plot the data on a scatter plot to visualize the data.

Gradient Descent:

In this part, I will ﬁt the linear regression parameters θ to the dataset using gradient descent.

The objective of linear regression is to minimize the cost function



After I have implemented gradient descent algo and trained the model, the linear regression line should appear on the scatter plot.
